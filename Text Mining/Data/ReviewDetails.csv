If you want to go for iphone which can compete with high end android phones, this is the one. I have used the Oneplus 7T for 2.5 months (and sold it) and can say after comparison that the photos that iPhone 11 takes are way better than OP 7T. The battery has been performing really well after all daily chores, youtube, spotify, netflix, etc. I have last charged the phone to 100% at 9.12 pm and as I write this review (12.54 pm next day), I have got 30% left. I used to have an iphone 6s which I used for 4 years after which I bought the OP 7T. Now that I am back to the ios ecosystem, it does feel good! Also, trust me, the transition back to a Liquid Retina display from 90Hz does not feel bad, because Apple has really done a good job is maintaining a crisp and vibrant display in iPhone 11.

"B08L89J9G3","Apple iPhone 11 (64GB) - Green","4.6","10655","Lalit 009","","Verified Purchase","","","","4.0","February 21, 2020","India","My mom got this phone after using oneplus 5t for 2 years and for change she wanted to try iOS. As she is not a heavy user and not a pixel peeper and also inclines towards fancy colored phones[previously lava red 5t] I thought of advising her to go for iPhone 11. Now coming to the phone or should I say iPhone, it is really a good one fulfilling many of its duties; I'll just list out a few points regarding the phone: Pros: A great camera with realistic colors[not highly saturated] The best video recording on a mobile[as of Feb 2020] Somewhere between great to excellent battery life The software experience is great if you're into ""apple way"" of things and the whole experience is just FLUIDIC The phone feels expensive and gives you a feel-good factor and also the build is pretty stellar even if some people are commenting that it's sides are alluminium and not steel. Cons: Many buyers and even youtubers are saying that the display is great and you wont notice the difference in day to day life but I dont want to sugarcoat things! The display is DECENT and NOT great! In day to day life with texting applications and general usage of phone you wont feel any difference, that is correct, BUT when you get into media apps like youtube, NETFLIX, ... etc you will notice the difference of lower resolution. there's just no escaping that fact. You will also notice a great difference in screenshots containing text. The display, in my opinion, would be the main deal breaker for me but in my case the phone is for my mom and she's not a tech geek and she's loving the purple color and the camera of the phone. And also if you're into data transferring between your phone and your laptop[windows laptop] this phone will frustrate you for sure. For this I will suggest you to rely on cloud based services and not on manual cable sync process. Conclusion with personal thoughts: Overall the phone is a great one if you're not a tech geek and want the latest iPhone. It's also a great pick for those who want great hardware with flagship tech but prefer watching media on laptop or smart TV.","","Overall a great phone just not a perfect one.","46","https://www.amazon.in/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFH6AYZYVAU7IWGWABQU6HNYFZIA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8","https://www.amazon.in/product-reviews/B08L89J9G3/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=5&filterByStar=all_stars&sortBy=helpful&reviewerType=all_reviews","Apple","https://www.amazon.in/gp/customer-reviews/R31SON0S4OSE3N/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B08L89J9G3","https://www.amazon.in/New-Apple-iPhone-11-64GB/dp/B08L89J9G3/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?keywords=mobiles&qid=1639733798&sr=8-1-spons&spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUFJVFhXUjRNTU1KOSZlbmNyeXB0ZWRJZD1BMTAwNjkzMTI3RDlPQU01MkZCUEomZW5jcnlwdGVkQWRJZD1BMDE5NDYyMjJVQU4xTDVFQVNRV1Imd2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9hdGYmYWN0aW9uPWNsaWNrUmVkaXJlY3QmZG9Ob3RMb2dDbGljaz10cnVl&th=1"

"B08L89J9G3","Apple iPhone 11 (64GB) - Green","4.6","10655","pk2013","","Verified Purchase","","","","4.0","August 10, 2020","India","Been almost 10 months I have been using the iPhone 11 128 GB. Apple is known as one of the premium phone manufacturers who do not compromise on quality, user experience and simplicity (company claims). It is certain that the Apple products have a brand appeal in the Indian market. This appeal allows them to charge a surplus from the customers for their products. Opinions differ if this is justified. For me, I like to evaluate the phone’s features with the cost. The build quality And design of this phone is absolutely fantastic! Curves at the right places, the tactile buttons, it just screams premium. When you pick up the phone, you feet the weight. I came into this phone from a Samsung galaxy and the first thing I notice is the disparity in the weight. This is probably due to the LCD screen on the former as compared to OLED in the galaxy series. The screen on Iphone 11is a “Liquid Retina display”; fancy term for a highly polished, well optimised LCD screen. It is a good screen. It is just slightly above 720p resolution but in everyday activities most people won’t notice it. I noticed it. For me, the screen is a major downside of this phone. You are shelling out almost 70000 ₹, the customer deserves at least a 1080p (full HD) screen. Today when most of the “budget” phones come with 1080p screen, the step back by Apple is definitely not appreciated. It is also necessary to mention, I prefer OLED screen over LCD due to their deep blacks and high contrast ratio. But surprisingly, this LCD screen on the iPhone is better than a few OLED screens I compared it to!(albeit comparing at the same resolution)- Xaomi note series, vivo and oppo. Only Samsung screens were ridiculously amazing even in their M series phones. Another positive of iPhone is the amazing battery life. I am a very heavy user with lots of videos, streaming music all the time, Bluetooth on, WiFi on, location on, browsing, multiple calls daily, video conference meetings, push email- official and personal, light browsing on social media sites and a lot of photos/videos. This beast survives the whole day! But the thing that irks me is the puny 5 watt charger in the box. It takes close to 3 h to charge from 10% to 96%! I suggest you buy a 12 watt charger that is sold separately. Apple should have provided a 12 watt charger in the box at the price point. Another frustrating part of the Apple ecosystem is the iCloud storage that essentially is required if you want to back up phone/photos etc. this costs 79₹ for 50GB PER MONTH. Apple pulls you into their ecosystem with their services, which I must say are excellent. The Apple ecosystem is stress free and just seamless. The phrase “it just works” really works here. I have an MacBook Pro and the iPhone works really well with my laptop allowing me to answer calls, messages right from my laptop. The one feature I wasn’t too sure of, which grew on me until the start of pandemic, is the face recognition. It’s safe, secure and absolutely amazing. It works for all authentication requirements of the phone and is beautiful. I understand now the appeal of face recognition and the “soli” chip on the google pixel4. Btw, the pandemic and the accompanying masks have created a hurdle for the face recognition. Today I wonder if the fingerprint would have been better than the fancy face recognition. One of my favourite is the cameras! It’s Apple! They made their name and reputation on cameras. I won’t say too much on this topic as it’s well known. Only google pixel can compete in the photos department but they iPhone is definitely the video kings. Another key area in which Apple has made their name is the security, encryption and privacy policy. This is one of the major reasons for their premium price tags. I give this phone a very enthusiastic 4 stars. I wish they improve the screen at this price point to at least a 1080p and include a respectable charger in the box. I have not talked about the OS as I believe iOS or android is a personal choice and I am reviewing the key features of the iPhone and it’s hardware.","","Beast with a limp","37","https://www.amazon.in/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFT3JH3KSI4DFOUBOXSXIMD2RYXA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8","https://www.amazon.in/product-reviews/B08L89J9G3/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=6&filterByStar=all_stars&sortBy=helpful&reviewerType=all_reviews","Apple","https://www.amazon.in/gp/customer-reviews/R1IGXN3DRQT5SL/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B08L89J9G3","https://www.amazon.in/New-Apple-iPhone-11-64GB/dp/B08L89J9G3/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?keywords=mobiles&qid=1639733798&sr=8-1-spons&spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUFJVFhXUjRNTU1KOSZlbmNyeXB0ZWRJZD1BMTAwNjkzMTI3RDlPQU01MkZCUEomZW5jcnlwdGVkQWRJZD1BMDE5NDYyMjJVQU4xTDVFQVNRV1Imd2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9hdGYmYWN0aW9uPWNsaWNrUmVkaXJlY3QmZG9Ob3RMb2dDbGljaz10cnVl&th=1"

No, I haven't sold my kidney as I got this for about 58K. I have been an avid Android Fanboy using 1+ as my daily driver for the past 5 years. The switch using move to iOS and the entire transition using Drive, Photos etc.. It has been seamless. I may miss a thing or two about 1+ with what a stock Android would offer. Couple of my colleagues argued how good the latest 1+ phones are. Two things that 1+ will never be good at. Photography and Intermittent lag. Yes, a phone with 12 Gigs of ram lags! Now, off to the device. Pros The device's build quality is amazing. The detail given in to every tiny little thing should be noted. Even the Sim tray is made out of metal. Speakers sound better than my previous phone. A couple of you might argue about LCD with lower resolution on the device. I certainly cannot differentiate that though. Color blind maybe! OS - There's no other mobile OS that is this speedy, updated on time basis and supports device for 5 long years. Yeah, you can root your phone and rock new Lineage OS on your Droid but the circumstances of rooting, Magisk cannot help Banking apps work. Camera - There are no other camera phones that are this good. Night mode is amazing. Such low light pictures turn out be so good. Note Huawei phones no longer have Google services yes you can sideload Play Store but that's still pain the arse. Next Pixel isn't going to be cheap either. Cons Remember an iPhone is always treated as an asset than a phone. Ask someone who has dropped his or her phone on a hard surface and the pain that it takes to have it repaired or replaced. Couple of them have pointed out that the device is a bit thick. Yes it is. Honestly slim phones cannot have more juice within. You have to sacrifice either of them. No 3.5MM means you can't charge and listen to music i.e. move on to wireless headphones. Overall an amazing phone that's worth every penny. And a phone that I'd be using for the next 5 years for sure just like my 1+ One The Legend. Electronic goods are always depreciating unlike Gold or Land and fits the needs of checking messages and making calls is all you need.","","iPhone XR with better Camera and Internals","249","https://www.amazon.in/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGHMYBTDUG4HFQEI2PVG2CH4MULQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8","https://www.amazon.in/product-reviews/B08L89J9G3/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=2&filterByStar=all_stars&sortBy=helpful&reviewerType=all_reviews","Apple","https://www.amazon.in/gp/customer-reviews/RIKWEAISQSPF8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B08L89J9G3","https://www.amazon.in/New-Apple-iPhone-11-64GB/dp/B08L89J9G3/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?keywords=mobiles&qid=1639733798&sr=8-1-spons&spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUFJVFhXUjRNTU1KOSZlbmNyeXB0ZWRJZD1BMTAwNjkzMTI3RDlPQU01MkZCUEomZW5jcnlwdGVkQWRJZD1BMDE5NDYyMjJVQU4xTDVFQVNRV1Imd2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9hdGYmYWN0aW9uPWNsaWNrUmVkaXJlY3QmZG9Ob3RMb2dDbGljaz10cnVl&th=1"

Now it’s been over a month since I have been using it and I feel that it’s the worst product from Apple. I don’t know what’s the reason but even after two updates, I feel that the touch is not working well and it keeps hanging on. The camera is not very wow but works well (looking at the price it’s not something really great...this much is expected at least). Also, the Face ID doesn’t work most of the times. And it takes more than 5 seconds to realise that it now needs to show up the regular pin/pattern to unlock. Even otherwise, I personally don’t find Face ID to be successful. To be true my four year old nephew finds it really easy to open this as he would keep my phone ready to capture my attention and would say something that would lead me to look at the phone unknowingly.","","Not a great phone","21","https://www.amazon.in/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFQ5YTYHIKOPIDTVUTENHVAHRBEA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8","https://www.amazon.in/product-reviews/B08L89J9G3/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=7&filterByStar=all_stars&sortBy=helpful&reviewerType=all_reviews","Apple","https://www.amazon.in/gp/customer-reviews/R3P5THGN9ILDJP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B08L89J9G3","https://www.amazon.in/New-Apple-iPhone-11-64GB/dp/B08L89J9G3/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?keywords=mobiles&qid=1639733798&sr=8-1-spons&spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUFJVFhXUjRNTU1KOSZlbmNyeXB0ZWRJZD1BMTAwNjkzMTI3RDlPQU01MkZCUEomZW5jcnlwdGVkQWRJZD1BMDE5NDYyMjJVQU4xTDVFQVNRV1Imd2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9hdGYmYWN0aW9uPWNsaWNrUmVkaXJlY3QmZG9Ob3RMb2dDbGljaz10cnVl&th=1"

Kudos to Amazon, seller & delivery partner in prompt delivery as promised & in perfect condition. Below is my quick review after a month of usage - Pros 1. Premium feel at hand & ease of use especially after coming a decade of being Android user. 2. No battery heating or draining. Lasts for about 3days with very casual usage - office call, mails, few apps. Please note i have not installed any games or heavy intense apps. 3. Camera quality is the best that i have experienced. 4. Face ID works like charm & very useful in authentication while installing apps or view the notifications on lock screen. 5. Call quality, data connection & connectivity felt immediately better compared to my earlier phone. Cons 1. Only nick picking on the charger not being provided in this new version. IF you have any USB C charger at home, you can leverage the same to charge this phone since USB C cable is provided. 2. Cannot use 3.5mm jack based headsets. Need Bluetooth headset or lightening port connectors. Per my experience, I would definitely recommend iPhone11 since i do not see any potential cons.

Excellent phone with sleek screen 2. Excellent battery lasting more than a day 3. Face recognition is smooth CONS: 1. Just the exchange process is very very complex If you are exchanging an old phone strongly recommend not to do so. If you wish to do so here are the steps 1. Please take complete back up in advance of the phone you like to exchange 2. Erase all data except Amazon app. Even if you have the Amazon app on a different phone, please have Amazon app installed on the phone which you are going to give away 3. Once the delivery agent comes to you, ask for a pin 6 digit number. 4. You have to first enter the six digit number on the phone in the Amazon app on the order. Yes, this has to be keyed in on same order you had made and there is a provision space to enter on same. 5. This step is quite complex but this is done for security to ensure you exchange the right phone. 6. Once validated (Takes about 10 to 30 minutes depending on data / passwords you have stored) you then have to provide a 6 digit OTP which you would have received on your mobile and email. 7. Then the agent verifies the 6 digit OTP on his device. 8. If this gets done, PLEASE ENSURE YOU REMOVE YOUR SIM , DELETE THE AMAZON APP AND DATA FROM THE device you are going to give away. 9. Final but most important - ensure the device is deleted from iCloud if you are exchanging iPhone . If non iPhone ensure you format the phone and ONLY THEN HAND IT OVER TO DELIVERY AGENT. 10. In any possibility it would take 10 to 45 minutes to complete the exchange steps above depending on your data on phone plus the support of delivery or customer service. I had to wait for 24 hours to re do all steps and then went for it as I urgently needed this phone. Else best to exchange in a store nearby and just go for phone.

The battery has been performing really well after all daily chores, youtube, spotify, netflix, etc. I have last charged the phone to 100% at 9.12 pm and as I write this review (12.54 pm next day), I have got 30% left.

The design is insanely good. Lot of reviews say that they received a damaged phone but that is simply not true!! The truth is the phone comes with an outdated iOS and you must update it. Or else your camera won’t be running normally or the video quality won’t be more than 360p( as it was in my case). But once you do a software update, all the bugs gets fixed. Also a lot of them seem to say that the phone gets overheated. I thought mine was getting overheated too. But there’a a difference between it being warm and overheating. The truth is it gets warm if you do intense processing. ( The software update took care of that too and I don’t know how). So don’t worry about buying a iPhone here. A lot of them are freaking out that their phones aren’t functioning properly and they were too quick to write a bad review. Truth is a software update fixes all these people’s complaints.","","Absolutely LOVE it !!!","73","https://www.amazon.in/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AG5TYLXCUVJRLARCL4TDKGRTVY3Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8","https://www.amazon.in/product-reviews/B08L89J9G3/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=4&filterByStar=all_stars&sortBy=helpful&reviewerType=all_reviews","Apple","https://www.amazon.in/gp/customer-reviews/R3EYPUAE6B94QG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B08L89J9G3","https://www.amazon.in/New-Apple-iPhone-11-64GB/dp/B08L89J9G3/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?keywords=mobiles&qid=1639733798&sr=8-1-spons&spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUFJVFhXUjRNTU1KOSZlbmNyeXB0ZWRJZD1BMTAwNjkzMTI3RDlPQU01MkZCUEomZW5jcnlwdGVkQWRJZD1BMDE5NDYyMjJVQU4xTDVFQVNRV1Imd2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9hdGYmYWN0aW9uPWNsaWNrUmVkaXJlY3QmZG9Ob3RMb2dDbGljaz10cnVl&th=1"

I ordered the device on sale, from delhi, seller: appario. The device is genuine. Authentic with one year warranty. One week+ , review: the phone is working as expected. Apple devices,i believe, are not for hard usage and i bought this to put some restrictions on myself. Will update again after some time. I saw people writing negative reviews about appario so i felt fear that i made a mistake.. but then last year my friend ordered XR on sale during october like i did this year.. He said that people who are happy with thier product are less likely to write a feedback and those who do not get as promised are the once who lash out which is fair. So here i am writing this. First two days review Battery life ok Camera natural light good, artificial good (artificial zoom avg) Face id good Interface once u get everything its hard to not track everything Rest everything is typical apple Con Phone is heavy hahaha Ill try to keep updating.. Update: phone is working good the way i use it my phone is still at 100% capacity.. daily avg use is 2:30hrs to 4:15hrs I have not installed any google apps at all. And no streaming apps Only work and paytm and banking apps With social media apps excluding facebook Update #2 it is almost a year now and my bettery health is still at 100%. i charge at 30% and till 82-86% no fb snapchat or any google app. PEACE.","","Honest review.

The main problem is the battery it is long if you dont play any games , if you use the phone for using social media and camera you can go for it . But ya another problem is the refresh rate if you dont know refresh rate it is screen smoothness . it has 60 hz of refresh rate and all the phones in budget have 120 hz to 144 hz . And the build quality is good but if it one times fall from your hand it is gone .

"B08L89J9G3","Apple iPhone 11 (64GB) - Green","4.6","10655","Abhishek Mukherjee","","Verified Purchase","","","","5.0","August 10, 2020","India","From the last 3 months, i was waiting for the best possible phone in every aspect. I got to know about iphone 11 being one of the best selling apple products. Watched lots of videos on youtube related to unboxing, reviews. Especially i was looking for cons rather than pros. I got to know that the display not being oled is not that good. Then i compared it with iphone 11 pro and i got to know that build and display is only better in pro model, except that everything is same. I came to a decision of buying the iphone 11 and purchased it on prime day sale on 62k with discounts. From the last 3 weeks have been using iphone 11 as my primary phone and i can say it has been the best decision of my life. ios is buttery smooth, its 120hz touch response rate gives you a 90hz refresh rate feeling. No lag whatsoever. Ram management is superb. Sound quality is topline having that loud stereo speakers. Though i can say the speakers are not as loud as what i had seen in asus rog 3(being a reviewer on youtube) i get review units. Next the battery life is as good as a 5000mah android phone. It can easily last for a day and a half with moderate usage including gaming. The display might be not that vibrant and saturated like oled panels but its super bright and the blacks are much richer than what you see on other lcd panels(afterall its apple, you get what you pay). Finally the camera makes you feel like so great. The photos might not look that good in phone but transfer it to your pc, you will see the clarity of the camera. Video quality is superb. So overall a must buy if you are planning to invest in a phone which can last for the upcoming 5yrs. Hope my review helps ppl still deciding whether to buy iphone 11 or not.","","The best decision of my life","20","https://www.amazon.in/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AHQMHKWMPVUT34F7UI2BHSQRAACQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8","https://www.amazon.in/product-reviews/B08L89J9G3/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=7&filterByStar=all_stars&sortBy=helpful&reviewerType=all_reviews","Apple","https://www.amazon.in/gp/customer-reviews/RISV9C4ZE4TDO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B08L89J9G3","https://www.amazon.in/New-Apple-iPhone-11-64GB/dp/B08L89J9G3/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?keywords=mobiles&qid=1639733798&sr=8-1-spons&spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUFJVFhXUjRNTU1KOSZlbmNyeXB0ZWRJZD1BMTAwNjkzMTI3RDlPQU01MkZCUEomZW5jcnlwdGVkQWRJZD1BMDE5NDYyMjJVQU4xTDVFQVNRV1Imd2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9hdGYmYWN0aW9uPWNsaWNrUmVkaXJlY3QmZG9Ob3RMb2dDbGljaz10cnVl&th=1"
